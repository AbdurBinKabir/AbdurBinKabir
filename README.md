### I’m Abdur Kabir  
Hi, I’m Abdur Kabir. I’m curious about everything and love learning new skills. Here, I share what I learn through tutorials, tips, and small projects. Still learning, still sharing. 

• On this GitHub, I share my projects, experiments, and source code — showcasing my journey of learning, building, and creating.  
• I’m passionate about clean code, UI/UX design, and turning ideas into interactive digital realities.  
• Always exploring new tools and technologies to improve my craft.  

Thanks for stopping by — feel free to explore my repositories and connect!
